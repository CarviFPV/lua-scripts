# Lua-scripts

The goal for this repo is to have a central place to share example Lua scripts, host any 'new' scripts, and to document where to find Lua scripts that already exist, as well as any tips or tricks related to getting started with them. 

List of Lua-scripts:

* [Yaapu telemetry widget](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript) - ArduPilot LUA telemetry script
<br/>Currently for color screen radios, use [rotorman's fork](https://github.com/rotorman/FrskyTelemetryScript/tree/dev/HORUS/SOURCES/SRC) instead, that has EdgeTX color fixes, and also support for [OlliW MavSDK](http://www.olliw.eu/2020/olliwtelem/) ([EdgeTX PR #150](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/150))
